Text History:
You: Hey you coming to the reunion?
Relative: Wrong number buddy, ain’t nobody here going to a reunion.
You: Alrighty then, I’ll just tell Granny and [Relative 5] that you can’t go
Relative: AIGHT HOLD UP. 

Food:
You: So what’s this about you coming this year now?
Relative: Look, I was told that there wouldn’t be a lot of meat this year, so I figured there wouldn’t be a point in showing up, alright?
You: Whoever told you that lied. There’s always meat. Especially if you bring it yourself.
Relative: Won’t happen. Stove broke. I’ll see if I can find something easier.
You: Didn’t know you owned a stove. Just bring a salad or something.

Seating:
Relative: Hey what’s this about [Relative 5] not coming this year? Thought you said [Relative 5] was!
You: I didn’t say anything, just said [Relative 5] would be disappointed.  Still waiting on an rsvp
Relative: Well, if they show up, make sure I’m beside em alright? Got a lot of catching up to do
You: Sure, but only if you tell me what you’re bringing
Relative: Uh ok

Bringing:
Relative: Does trail mix count as an appetizer or a main dish?
You: Neither. Didn’t I tell you to bring a salad? What’s with trail mix?
Relative: I have a bunch of it! Figured I wouldn’t let it go to waste. Now what am I gonna do with it?
You: That’s not my problem.  What is my problem is you not confirming that you’ll bring something.
Relative: I’ll get back to you on that.
