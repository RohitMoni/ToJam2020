Text History:
You: Hi I hope I’ve got the right number, is this [Relative 6]?
Relative: OMG Hi! It’s been a while hasn’t it? How’d you get my number? :D
You:  Granny had it on her kitchen cue cards.  I’m hosting the reunion this year and figured I would message and ask if you were coming.  
Relative: Sure! Haven’t seen Granny in ages, think it’ll be a great time.  If I recall, I should bring something right?
You: Yes! Anything you could bring would be helpful.
Relative: Well, I can’t risk bringing anything [allergy] related… so how about turkey? :D
You: Sound perfect to me! Thank you so much

Food:
You: So is there anything food related that you want to confirm?
Relative: Not really, I’ve gotten to experience so many things while abroad. 

Seating:
Relative: Just wanted to ask, is [Relative 3] going to be there? :x
You: Uh let me check, but I think so?
Relative: Damn, was hoping that wasn’t the case. Oh well. 
You: Want me to make sure they aren’t beside you?
Relative: If it isn’t too much trouble <3

Bringing:
You: So have your travels been fun then?
Relative: Yes! 8D I had an absolute blast.  If I had more time, I’d probably bring some more interesting food.  Still moving things back in though.
You: No worries, pretty sure somebody would complain if you brought something that they couldn’t pronounce.
Relative: Why do you think I call it special turkey >_> 
You: Yes, you did say you were bringing turkey.
You: Wait, what makes it special?
Relative: It’ll be fine.  ;) I’ll just talk with everyone else and it’ll probably be fine.
