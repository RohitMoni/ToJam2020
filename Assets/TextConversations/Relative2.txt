You: Hey you said in your RSVP that you wanted to talk?
Relative: Yes! Thank you for contacting me! You are doing seating as well? Can you make sure that I get to sit beside Granny? I have LOTS to talk about!
You: Okay, I think I can do that, is that all?
Relative: No! I'm hoping to bring my 3 bean dip that I know Granny ADORES! 
You: Isn’t that her bean dip?

Food:
You: Just checking in, you fine with any veggie dish?
Relative: Not just ANY veggie dish will do! It better not be made by that [Relative 4] chump or it will sully the dip!
You: I’m not even sure they’re showing up…
Relative: HOW DARE THEY! This is GRANNY’S REUNION. I will give him a piece of MY MIND.

Seating:
You: Seating arrangements, you mentioned something?
Relative: As I said: Can you make sure that I get to sit beside Granny? 

Bringing: 
You: Hey, could you give me a bit more about your bean dip?
Relative: It's a secret recipe handed down by generations by our great great grandmother! I won't just give it up that easily!
You: I mean is that all your bringing? An appetizer?
Relative: It's not just an appetizer! It's a tradition! How dare you!
You: You know I don't mean that. Did you want anything WITH it?
Relative: Oh! I was hoping for a veggie dish to go with it if you don't mind!
